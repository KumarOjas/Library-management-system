# Library-management-system
This is a database management system project that has been built as a part of my second year project. 
Library management system  is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of a library.
The system helps both students and library and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library.
The main feature of this system is that all the books available in yhe library can be displayed in a list so that students need not roam through the entire library to find a book.Additionally the application is effectively maintains the details of users to whom books have been issued.
